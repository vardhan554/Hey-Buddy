Repository for Starting Python- First Notebook

How are you doing guys? This is Vishnu Kondaveeti reporting to the Team.
Here we are about to learn some concepts about GIT and GIT-HUB.
Just trying to make myself comfortable in this software field, i know this is not my comfort zone, trying to come out of it and adapt to the chnages in my life.
Hope everything goes good!!

Thank you :D
